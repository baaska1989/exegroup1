      '▶ "Meeting people from different nationalities". 3 months were a short but stimulating experience that broadened my perspective. The opportunity to interact with professionals in the business world was invaluable, providing advice on job hunting and insights into working overseas and women in the workforce.',
    text1_3:
      "▶ Safe study abroad system even in an unstable situation. Under the military regime, I was anxious, but I was able to concentrate on my internship without any inconvenience because of the generous support from everyone from the initial visa arrangements to the final returning to Japan. Not only did I receive advice that helped me grow both in terms of my life and work, but I also had opportunities to consult with them regularly about my job hunting activities.",
    text1_4: "T.M, Tokyo University of Foreign Studies, Burmese Studies: ",
    text1_5:
      '▶ "The communication with the local staff". I was worrying about the completely different life style in Myanmar rather than Japan. But by daily communication withe Myanmar staffs quickly dispelled my anxieties. Not only did I learn about business, but I also managed to acquire Burmese language skills through conversations with the staff. The warmth of the people I met during this internship left a lasting impression, and I feel that I have grown as a person.',
    text1_6:
      '▶ "I was amazed by the safety and warmth of the people in Myanmar". What impressed me most about this internship was the warmth of the people. From start to finish, the hotel staff was so kind to me and treated me like a true family member. Every day was really fulfilling and passed by so quickly. I will never forget this experience, and I think I have grown more than before after completing the internship.',
    text1_7: "E.M, Sophia University, Education Studies: ",
    text1_8:
      "▶ After participating in the internship, the first thing that surprised me was how safe Myanmar is and how friendly the people are. Myanmar is a country of devout Buddhists and the under developed communication system protected the country from the information over flow. And I think this made the people even more calm and prosperous. Myanmar will change in 10 years. I am very grateful that I was able to participate in this timing.",
    text1_9:
      '▶ "Challenging schedule of the internship". The internship period was two weeks. My main job was to share my sense of cleanliness as a Japanese person with the local staff. I knew nothing about the hotel industry, so it was a lot of pressure for me to share my own ideas for improvement, but the Japanese managers supported me as much as possible. It was my nourishment to feel the process of striving for the aim of achieving my goals even though I struggling. It was a challenging internship for me, but it was a very intense two weeks.
